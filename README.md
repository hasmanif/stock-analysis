## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project is a detailed analysis of a large set of stocks data in a macro-enabled excel document that summarizes the information into individual ticker volume and change in price with conditional formatting for visual interpretation of the change in price.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The Theater outcomes have the most successful projects in May. Canceled projects do not have much of a variance as they range between 3 - 4 cancelled projects each month with the exception of January which has the most canceled shows by double (7). It is fair to say that canceled shows are not dependant on independant months or volume of projects. We can also say that failed projects average around 40 with December almost tying to the same amount of successful projects as failed. After the month of May, successful theater projects decline at a steady rate as failed project remain contstant. We can assume that there are other factors playing significant roles on the success of a play.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Smaller projects with goals less than $5,000 are largely more successful than the larger projects with the exception of projects in between $35,000 - $44,999. Its fair to say that since the number of projects total 9 projects between the 2 data points, it can be seen as these projects were unique since the successful line has a natural declining slope and is inversely related to the number of failed projects. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Out of the total of 1,047 projects, 720 are less than 4,999 which means that there are more values available to projects less than $4,999 to get a better representation of the percentage of successful projects. It could be fair to say, with a larger data set, the graph could show a smoother decline in successful projects as the goal increases. Another limitation would be the popularity of each project could play a significant role on whether the project has a higher change of being pledged/backed. This could give us a better understanding on why some of the larger projects were greatly successful. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A great table to create would be a representation between the outcomes of each project vs the timeframe. We could see how the timeframe could affect the success of a goal at various goal points. Another great table would be the amount of backers for each project versus the outcome. It could be that larger amount of backers could lead to higher success rates and could potentially be evidence of popularity of each project. I find that popularity of a project could be a huge quantitative data set that could give further insight on why certain projects succeed and other fail.
